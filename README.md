#EpicGame
 A framework for developing games in Minecraft using the Bukkit API.
----------

EpicGame is a framework designed and developed for the creation of extended-gameplay games (e.g. an MMORPG). This is **not** a functional plugin by itself, but a framework for developers to use.

###Building:
----------
EpicGame uses Maven to manage the build process. Typically, building the plugin would consist of these commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrlolethan/EpicGame.git
$ cd EpicGame
$ mvn
```
